# Zero: Energy Resource Optimizer

In this project, we design a system which can help individuals optimize cost effectiveness of their electricity usage. While this seems pretty selfish, we demonstrate methods to minimize the effects of selfish consumption. This would eventually help aggregate consumption over a demography.

## Libraries you'd need
1. `python 3.6`
2. `numpy`
3. `math`
4. `wemo_acess`
5. `Tkinter` (choose according to your system, there exists a myraid of choices)
